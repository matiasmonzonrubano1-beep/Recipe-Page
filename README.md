## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank the user [lilianaad7](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/lilianaad7) for her feedback on my previous solution, where she pointed out how the way I was aproaching styles was not only inefficent but also overly complex. After reading her solution I figured out how to properly manage styles and semantic tags in a more ordered manner
